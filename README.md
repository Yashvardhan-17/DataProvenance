# Data Provenance Assurance Using Ethereum Blockchain
The Data Provenance and Assurance Framework is employed to check the provenance of a document previously uploaded by a user. It verifies whether the data has been altered and preserves these details on the immutable and distributed Ethereum Blockchain Network. The web application's front-end was developed using React, while the smart contracts were authored in Solidity. IPFS is utilized to generate a hash value for the file, which is subsequently stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
## Objectives
* To develop a data provenance assurance framework for the cloud environment by integrating Ethereum Blockchain and IPFS.
* To design an optimized consensus algorithm using the go-Ethereum protocol for the blockchain network.
* To evaluate the performance analysis of the proposed algorithm with the existing algorithm in different scenarios in terms of efficinecy and scalablity

## Functional Requirements
* A robust login module should be present that would allow only authenticated users to log in and access the application.
* The application should include an efficient and user-friendly file upload module, using which users can upload file of various sizes and formats.
* The application should include a check provenance module which would facilitate the users to verify the provenance of the files.
* The IPFS should generate hash values for every uploaded file to provide uniqueness andimmutability.
* The hash value to be stored into blockchain.


## Non Functional Requirements
* Each request should be sent to the provenance author within a second.
* The user should be able to login/register within a second.

## Future Scope
The future scope of this project would be to develop the data provenance for multi-cloud platform.
