# DataProvenance And Assurance Framework Using Ethereum Blockchain
The Data Provenance and Assurance Framework is employed to check the provenance of a document previously uploaded by a user. It verifies whether the data has been altered and preserves these details on the immutable and distributed Ethereum Blockchain Network. The web application's front-end was developed using React, while the smart contracts were authored in Solidity. IPFS is utilized to generate a hash value for the file, which is subsequently stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
